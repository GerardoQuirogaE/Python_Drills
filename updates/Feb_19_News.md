### Updates

Today I will be learning about:

*Continuous Integration* and *Continuous Delivery or Deployment (CI/CD)*.

I want to reach a professional level of engineering where my code always works, rolls back in case of a bug, and can make it all look pretty while I focus on what's important: writing, creating content, and developing the project.

**First, what is CI/CD?**

    CI/CD is a software development and IT opperations (DevOps) methodology that automates building, testing, and deploying code changes. 

**A bit of history.**

From the 2000's on, updates have had to become more frequent as accessibility increases, and there are more end-poit users. In the begining, computers read paper punched with specific paterns to encode any meaning. To share the code, phisical containers had to be shipped, and the end users tend to be the same computer scientists that made the machines. From the dot-bubble on, code can be shared across the internet, both to interact with the code in a website, and to see how it works on a repository. This great achievement also comes with a challenge: more accessibility requires more updates, but with more updates and them having a larger inpact on people, they have to be reliable every time. **This is where CI/CD comes to play.**

    By automating how the code will be deployed, built, and tested, then developers can focus more of their time in adding to the project rather than fixing it.

**What to learn to stay competitive?**

A CI/CD tool that is growing in popularity, because it is native to the largest cloud-hosted version control tool, is `GitHub Actions`.

I here is my synthesis on github actions:
