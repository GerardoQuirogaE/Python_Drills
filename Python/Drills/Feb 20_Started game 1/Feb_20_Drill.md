# Howdy!

Today, my drill is a bit different. Because I have lots of classwork, I will claim my work on the repo as my drill. After all, it is coding anyway. I will link the work here so that you can check if it is BS or not anyway. 

## Todays Plan:

* I will be finishing my first game with pygame as part of today's drill
* I will also be working on the script that updates and makes each day's news.
* I will also draw characters, backgrounds, and different pixel art animations for the upcoming games
* In a similar note, I will write a story line of how the first two games will play.

These are the deliverables

|Repo Improvements|
|:----|
|**Built**:|
|[Game 1 Outline](../../../Data/graphics/game_1/game_1.md). I will write a storyline / game outline to know what should happen chronologically in the game in natural language, then I can actualy create graphics and write code.|
|[Dino_Game Base Spinosaurus](../../../Data/graphics/game_1/Spinosaurus/base_dino.png). Drew base character of Spinosaurus player.|
|[Dino_Game Mouth Spinosaurus](../../../Data/graphics/game_1/Spinosaurus/mouth/). Drew animation frames for Spinosaurus opening its mouth.|

|**Today's Agenda**:|
|[Finished First Pygame Tutorial](../../../Python/Drills/Feb%2020_Finished%20First%20Pygame%20Tutorial/Feb_20_Drill.md). This is my first game created using python. I followed the tutorial listed on the documentation page. |
|[News_Maker](../../../updates/scripts/news_maker.py) is a script that will update the news section of the main read me file. It essensialy preforms two tasks: It creates todays news, and archives yesterdays news.|

|**Coming Up Next:**:|
|*Repo Housekeeping*|
|[Drill_Update](../../../updates/scripts/drill_update.py) this is a script that will automatically generate a Today_Drill_Update.md file with the title of the project, a description, documentated creative process, and the specifications.|
|[Log](../../../updates/scripts/log.py) this script will automatically update log.md and it will contain a table with the date, the news article of the day's link, and the corresponding day's project file link.|
|*Drills*|
|[Pull-Up-inator](). I want to work on this script to make it more useful and to have more possible actions. I want to get it to the level that I start to use it in my every day life and it becomes indispensible.|
|*Learning*|
